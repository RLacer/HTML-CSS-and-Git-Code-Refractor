# Homework 1 

## Description of my work:

**HTML**

* I changed the title, so the tab no longer reads "website" when opened in a browser.
* I changed class =header to header.
* I changed div with the links to nav.
* I created an aside, the classes that had benefit-something (within the aside), were changed to class=benefit.
* I added alt text to all images and the "hero".
* I changed the class of the elements in main, from each part matching the id tag, to class=otherinf.

**CSS**
* I updated the header element to include the nav.
* I added comments to describe each section.
* When I updated the class in css, I was able to delete redundant styling.
